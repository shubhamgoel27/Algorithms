# Algorithms
Various algorithms implemented for learning purposes. They have been structured into different fields such as

1. Graph theory (E.g. **Fleury's Algorithm**, **Graph connectivity**, **Scheduling problem**)

2. Numerical methods (E.g. **Newton-Raphson**, **Regula-Falsi**,**Bisection search**, **Chebyshev**)

3. Sorting (E.g. **Bubble sort**, **Inversion Count using modified Merge sort**)
